            </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water
                    and bring to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine
                    at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite,
                    about 8 minutes. Drain well.</li>
                <li>While the pasta is cooking, place cubed
                    cooked chicken, Alfredo sauce, frozen
                    vegetables, mushrooms, and milk in a large
                    saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir
                    until chicken is heated through and vegetables
                    are tender.</li>
                <li>Serve warm Alfredo and chicken sauce over cooked noodles.</li>
            </ol>
